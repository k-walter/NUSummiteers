  text: "It’s Day 3 of NUSummiteers! Hope you’re roaring to go.\n\nDid you know that the mountain range situated in the Southern Island of New Zealand is known as the Southern Alps? And the highest peak in that range is none other than the famous Aoraki or <b>Mt. Cook (3,724m)</b>.\n\nThe first known ascent of the mountain was on Christmas Day in 1894 where a local team submitted via the Hooker Valley and the north ridge. Today, it remains one of the most popular challenges for mountaineers in New Zealand.\n\nDid you know that NUS Mountaineering used to conduct yearly Technical Mountaineering Courses (TMCs) in New Zealand too? Check out a throwback to MIR 2’s time there: bit.ly/NUSummiteers-NZ."

  text: "Did you know that there are peaks in the world named after Singaporeans? They are none other than <b>Ong Teng Cheong (4,743m)</b> and <b>Ong Siew May (4,451m)</b> peaks located in the Tienshan Range in Kazakhstan.\n\nNUS Mountaineering first sent a team to climb both peaks in 2017. Named after our late President Ong Teng Cheong, the peak was a homage to him as Mr Ong himself was the patron of Singapore’s first Everest expedition in 1995.\n\nTill today, this peak, which was first climbed by a Singaporean team on July 29, 2005, is believed to be the first in the world named after a Singaporean.\n\n⁣Check out our feature on The Straits Times here: bit.ly/MIR-OTCOSM-ST."

  text: "Have you ever heard of the Seven Summits? It’s a well-known mountaineering goal for many, which includes summiting the seven highest mountain peaks in each continent.\n\nHowever, there are many variations due to differences in opinions in terms of borders of each continent.\n\nFor example, whether or not one includes all of Oceania or only Australia as the continent, <b>Pucak Jaya (4,884m)</b> may or may not be counted. The peak, more famously known as Carstensz Pyramid is the highest in Indonesia.\n\nDespite having the lowest elevation, it is considered to be one of the most technically challenging climbs out of the Seven Summits.\n\nWill you take up this challenge some day? "

- datetime: [2020, 9, 22, 19]
  text: "Another one of the Seven Summits is none other than <b>Mt. Vinson (4,892m)</b>, which is the highest point in Antarctica.\n\nMt. Vinson is one of the most recently discovered and explored of the Seven Summits.\n\nOn 31 December 1999, four members of Singapore’s Antarctica 2000 expedition team, comprising the likes of Dr. Robert Goh, successfully reached the South Pole, after an arduous 1,125km trek that took two months to complete.\n\nA week later, on 7 January 2000, the other half of the expedition team, which included Edwin Siew, achieved summit success on Mt. Vinson itself, making them the first Singaporeans to reach the South Pole and Mt. Vinson’s summit that year.\n\nThis amazing adventure and achievement was told in the book Southbound: The Singapore Antarctica Expedition, which you can check out here: bit.ly/NUSummiteers-Antarctica."

  text: "It’s Day 5, which means we’re nearly halfway through NUSummiteers! How are you faring?\n\nDay 5 also means we’re pushing into 5,000m territory! Did you know that as part of our regular TMCs, NUS Mountaineering sends teams to the Himalayas to attempt 5,000m peaks? Of course, that’s done only after a long and challenging semester-worth of training!\n\nOne of the most common peaks attempted by our teams is none-other than <b>Baden-Powell Scout Peak (5,825m)</b>, in Langtang, Nepal.\n\nThe first ascent of the peak was done by an international team of Scouting members, which included members from Australia, Korea and even Singapore!\n\nCheck out an account from one of our recent teams: bit.ly/NUSummiteers-ScoutPeak."

  text: "Another less well-known but amazingly inspiring 5,000m peak is <b>Hkakabo Razi (5,881m)</b> - a mountain situated in northern Myanmar which has seen more failures than successes.\n\nIf measured accurately, it could be Southeast Asia’s true highest peak, but there hasn’t been a successful attempt as of yet. From bad weather to equipment failure to failed summit attempts, the peak continues to challenge climbers from around the world.\n\nIn November 2014, a National Geographic Society and The North Face team set out to measure the height of Hkakabo Razi.\n\nAttempted by some of the world’s best, like Hilaree Nelson, Cory Richards, and Renan Ozturk, the team was forced to turn back early and could only estimate that the summit was an additional 240m higher than where they stood.\n\nTheir journey of trials and tribulations was depicted in The North Face film: Down To Nothing, found here: bit.ly/NUSummiteers-HkakaboRazi."

We’re almost near the end, and for you, near the summit!\n\nDid you know that apart from MIR, SUTD too has their own student mountaineering club?\n\nIn 2004, a team of students from the university made a virgin ascent of a peak in Karcha Nala valley of Himachal Pradesh, and rightfully named it <b>Mount SUTD (6,056m)</b>.\n\nCheck out this inspiring accomplishment over at bit.ly/NUSummiteers-MtSUTD."

  text: "Most of us know that the highest peaks in the world are situated in Asia. But do you know what the highest peak outside of Asia is?\n\nWell, it’s none other than <b>Aconcagua (6,960m)</b> in Argentina. It is also regarded as the highest non-technical mountain in the world, since the northern route does not require ropes and ice tools to achieve an ascend.\n\nAlthough the climb is technically easy, multiple casualties occur every year due to a large number who underestimate the objective risks of elevation and cold weather.\n\nIs this a challenge you will be willing to take on?"

  text: "The summit is well in sight! You’ve just crossed the 7,000m mark!\n\nThe Snow Leopard award is a Soviet mountaineering award given to the very best of climbers. To receive this, a climber must have summited all five peaks of 7,000m and above located in the former Soviet Union, otherwise known as the Snow Leopards.\n\nOne of the five is none other than <b>Khan Tengri (7,010m)</b>, making it the second highest peak in the Tienshan range. The first ascent of the peak was made in 1931 by a Ukranian team from the south.\n\nDid you know that the first Singaporean to ascend Khan Tengri was none other than Kong Xieheng, an alumni of NUS Mountaineering?"

  text: "It’s Day 8! If you’ve received your goodie bag, you’d notice a book entitled ‘Xixabangma’ by Singaporean mountaineer and one of NUS Mountaineering’s founders Dr. Robert Goh.\n\n<b>Xixabangma (8,027m)</b> is but one of the 14 8000m-peaks in the world, and is situated entirely within Tibet, making it the last of the 8000s to be climbed. The first team to successfully ascend the peak was from China in 1964.\n\nSingaporean mountaineers Robert and Edwin Siew first conceived the idea of attempting the peak alpine-style in 2002, and successfully did so, which also gave birth to NUS Mountaineering, as we know it today.\n\nTheir accomplishment of an alpine ascent of the north ridge became the centrepiece of the book - do read and get inspired with what Singaporean mountaineers have done and can do!"

  text: "Situated in Pakistan, <b>Nanga Parbat (8,126m)</b> is the ninth highest mountain in the world.\n\nWhile several routes have been opened up to the summit of Nanga Parbat, the mountain as a whole is regarded as a very challenging, technical summit.\n\nIt was first climbed via the East Ridge, in 1953 by Austrian climber Hermann Buhl, a member of a German-Austrian team.\n\nThe mountain is known to also be a major player in modern superalpinism, which came to life in 1988 with the unsuccessful attempt or two on the Rupal Face by Barry Blanchard, Mark Twight, Ward Robinson and Kevin Doyle.\n\nIn February 2016, Nanga Parbat was finally successfully climbed in winter by a team which included Simone Moro."

  text: "It’s THE FINAL DAY OF NUSUMMITEERS and your last chance to clock your final elevation gains! Are you going to push yourself today?\n\nEveryone knows about Everest but how many knows about the second-highest peak, <b>K2 (8,611m)</b>?\n\nK2 is the highest peak in the Karakoram range and the highest point in both Pakistan and Xinjiang, China. There are a number of routes that exist today on K2 but all share some key difficulties such as extreme storms and steep, exposed and committing demands of the climb.\n\nThis is why K2 is often regarded as ‘The King of Mountains’ or ‘The Mountaineers’ Mountain’.\n\nA famous feature that has taken many lives on the mountain is a narrow couloir known as the ‘Bottleneck’, placing climbers dangerously close to a wall of seracs that form an ice cliff east of K2’s summit.\n\nThe collapse of a serac in 2001 was the reason why no climbers summited the peak in 2002 and 2003.\n\nYour final push awaits!"
